I needed a basic structure to start projects and get going quickly.
Here I installed the basic packages:
```
    "slim/slim": "4.*",
    "slim/psr7": "^1.7",
    "php-di/php-di": "^7.0"
```
and locked in the dependencies of the project, if update is needed call:
`php composer.phar update`.

## Getting started
to install dependencies call `php composer.phar install`.
